# About Moddie

Moddie is a Discord bot that is open source. It's main purpose is to serve as a developer-friendly alternative to bots like [Dyno](https://dyno.gg).

## Public Bot

While the most important part of this project is the fact anyone can self-host this bot, we offer a public bot which can be invited to your server using this [link](https://invite.moddie.xyz/)

## Self-host

As mentioned above this bot can be self-hosted. Because at the time of the release only the [Client](https://github.com/ModdieDiscord/Moddie) and the [Developer API](https://github.com/ModdieDiscord/ModdieAPI) have their source code publicly available, we let people [connect](https://moddie.zdigus.net/dashboard/developer/api) their bots to our main Developer API to use the publicly available [dashboard](https://dash.moddie.xyz/) as their dashboards, in a case where someone doesn't have knowledge to make their own Dashboard.

We plan to release source code to both the [dashboard](https://dash.moddie.xyz/) and the [admin dashboard](https://dash.moddie.xyz/admin) in the future.
